# Character-Mapping

The goal of this code is to build a program that will help to determine if there is one-to-one character mapping between two strings i.e. if all the character of String s1 can be properly mapped with all the characters of String s2. 

There are two approaches to this problem as stated below:

# Approach1

In this approach the mapping is done based on indexing i.e. if the character at index 0 of string s1 can be mapped with character at index 0 of string s2 and so on. Java code for this approach is with file name "CharacterMappingBasedOnIndex.java".

# Approach2

In this approach the mapping is done not based on indexing i.e. if the character at index 0 of string s1 can be mapped with any character of string s2 and so on. Java code for this approach is with file name "CharacterMapping.java".
